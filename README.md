#WEEK 1

* The Class introduced themselves to each other, which normally happens during first meetings.
* Our Professor, Sir Melvin introduced the course Dismath to us.
* We discussed the different classifications of **Truths**; *Scientific Truth*, *Authorative Truth*, *Legal Truth*, *Philosophical Truth*, *Probable Truth*.
* Sir Melvin discussed and explained the Knights and Knaves problem.
* The first meeting gave me an idea on what to expect for the course.
* I also learned the basic logical expressions, propositional logic and the truth table (*conjunction*, *disjunction*, *exclusive disjunction*, *conditional* and *biconditional*)

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:| :-----: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive Disjunction | xor |  p ⊕ q |
| → | Conditional | if, then | p → q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | p ↔ q |

- **Propositional Logic** (p → q)
- **Implication Equivalence** (p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q)
- **Inverse** (¬p → ¬q)
- **Converse**  (q → p)
- **Contrapositive** (¬q → ¬p)


| p | q | p ∧ q | p v q | p ⊕ q | p → q | p ↔ q |

| F | F | F | F | F | T | T |
| F | T | F | T | T | T | F |
| T | F | F | T | T | F | F |
| T | T | T | T | F | T | T |

#WEEK 2

* This week was where the real lecture began.
* I learned about logical equivalences 
    -   **Identity**
    -   **Domination**
    -   **Negation**
    -   **Double Negation**
    -   **Idempotent**
    -   **Commutative**
    -   **Associative**
    -   **Distributive**
    -   **De Morgan's**
    -   **Absorption**

* I learned about Quantifiers
    -   **Existential Quantifier** (∃x) - there exists x such that P(x)
    -   **Universal Quantifier** (∀x) - for every possible x

* I learned about the Rules of Inference
    - **Modus Ponens**
    - **Modus Tollens**
    - **Hypothetical Syllogism**
    - **Disjunctive Syllogism**
    - **Addition**
    - **Simplification**
    - **Conjunction**
    - **Resolution**
    
* There were so many things that I learned this week, at first it was confusing but once Sir Melvin explained thoroughly and gave some examples like the
Superman Problem, it was not as hard as it seems as long as you keep attention to what is being explained in the lecture because everything was connected.

#WEEK 3

* I learned the different methods of proof

   -  **Direct Proof**
   -  **Proof by Contraposition**
   -  **Vacuous Proof**
   -  **Trivial Proof**
   -  **Proof by Contradiction**(introduction)
   -  **Proof by Equivalence**(introduction)

* Discussed and Solved many problems regarding the first four methods of proof
* Sir Melvin only discussed a brief introduction about contradiction and equivalence

#WEEK 4

* Sir Melvin discussed about Proof by Contradiction and Equivalences
* Solved and Analyzed problems about the last two methods of proof

* Learned about Mathematical Induction

   -  **Basis Step**
   -  **Inductive Step**
